Haray!
------

Haray is a ray-tracer written in Haskell. My primary reason for writing a
ray-tracer is to learn more about the algorithms and challenges.

TODO
-----

  * Implement some sort of space division so that larger scenes can be rendered.
  * Add an option for global illumination.
  * Make a real scene description language.
  * Add support for offloading computation to GPU.
